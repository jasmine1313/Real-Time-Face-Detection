# Real-Time-Face-Detection
Real-Time Face Detection

Overview
Real-Time Face Detection is a project that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect human faces in real-time. The application is built using state-of-the-art machine learning models and offers seamless integration with live video streams or recorded videos.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Detect faces in live video streams with low latency, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis.

High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in face detection, even in challenging conditions.

Multiple Faces: Capable of detecting multiple faces simultaneously, making it ideal for applications in crowded environments.

Cross-Platform: Compatible with various platforms and devices, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Easy Integration: Simple to integrate into existing projects through APIs or as a standalone application.

How it Works
Real-Time Face Detection employs a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other computer vision techniques to analyze video frames and identify faces. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robust performance across different scenarios.
